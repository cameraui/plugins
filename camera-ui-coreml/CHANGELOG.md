## [1.2.1]

- **A "Reset to Defaults" button in every settings section.** One click puts all values of that section back to the defaults, models included.
- **A new "default" choice in every model dropdown.** It follows the recommended model for that task, so plugin updates can improve the pick automatically. Choosing a concrete model still pins it. Existing setups keep their current selection.
- **Five new face detection models.** Small and medium tiers plus 640 px variants of each size (t, s, m). The 640 models catch small and distant faces the 320 px default misses, at a higher compute cost. The default model stays unchanged.

## [1.2.0]

- Models load much faster after the first start. The compiled model is kept on disk and reused instead of being recompiled on every plugin start.
- Fixed the "Re-download Models" button doing nothing. Pressing it failed with a handler error in the log.
- Bump camera.ui SDK, requires camera.ui 2.0.23 or newer
